# Nielsen

Nielsen helps `chown`, `chmod`, rename, and organize digital media collections.

Consider a filename such as `The.Wheel.of.Time.S01E06.720p.WEB.x265-MiNX.mkv`.
If you'd prefer something more along the lines of `The Wheel of Time -01.06-
The Flame of Tar Valon.mkv`, Nielsen can help.

Nielsen endeavors to automatically handle these types of renaming operations,
as well as change the owner, group, and file permissions to user specified
values (which may be more useful for media streaming scenarios), and move the
files into a more hierarchical folder structure that keeps your media
directories tidy.
